Role: You are a Senior Transportation Engineer and an expert in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 7th Edition). Use the HCM MCP tool to perform a two-lane highway directional operational analysis. Do not estimate or assume any values. If the tool is unavailable, use web searching or attached file.

Task: Perform a directional operational analysis for a Two-Lane Highway.

Objective: Determine the Level of Service (LOS) for the eastbound direction of WIS 35/WIS 65 (River Falls Bypass) under summer, dry-weather conditions. 

Facility Classification:

* Terrain: Level/Rolling (Specific grades provided below).

Input Data (Global Parameters):

* Lane Width (LW): 12 ft
* Shoulder Width (SW): 6 ft
* Access Point Density (APD): 2 access points/mi
* Heavy Vehicles (P_{HV}): 8% (0.08)
* Peak Hour Factor (PHF): 0.94
* Demand Flow Rate (V): 512 veh/h
* Opposing Demand Flow Rate (V_o): 512 veh/h
* Base Free-Flow Speed (BFFS): 55 mph (Assumed based on speed limit)
* Heavy Vehicle Equivalence (E_T): Use standard HCM values for Rolling terrain unless grade is specific.

Segment Configuration:
*Note: If subsegment lengths sum to a different value than the "Total Length," prioritize the sum of the subsegments.*

* Segment 1:
* Type: Passing-constrained (No Passing Zone)
* Length: 0.16 mi
* Grade: 1%


* Segment 2:
* Type: Passing Zone (100% Passing allowed)
* Length: 0.64 mi
* Grade: 1%


* Segment 3 (Complex Alignment):
* Type: Passing-constrained (No Passing Zone)
* Grade: 0%
* Subsegments (Order of travel):
1. Tangent: 3,200 ft
2. Curve: 2,850 ft (R = 840 ft, e = 2\%)
3. Tangent: 2,200 ft
4. Curve: 1,800 ft (R = 845 ft, e = 2\%)
5. Tangent: 2,300 ft


* Segment 4:
* Type: Passing Zone (100% Passing allowed)
* Length: 0.625 mi
* Grade: 0%


* Segment 5 (Complex Alignment):
* Type: Passing-constrained (No Passing Zone)
* Grade: 1%
* Subsegments:
1. Tangent: 1,848 ft
2. Aggregated Curves: 6,600 ft (R = 2,520 ft, e = 2\%)

Output Requirements:
Provide the results in two formats:

1. Intermediate detail calculations for each step.

2. Summary Table: A clean Markdown table containing:
* Segment ID
* Adjusted FFS (mph)
* Average Travel Speed (ATS)
* Percent Follower (%)
* Follower Density (FD)
* Segment LOS
* Facility Level Follower Density
* Facility Level LOS

3. Inspections: A professional perspective for the result.
