For two lane highway segments, can you calculate level of service on this section?

The problems demonstrate the computational steps involved in applying the two-lane highway automobile and bicycle methodologies.

Description: Level, straight, Passing Constrained segment
Type of Analysis: Operational analysis

CONSTRAINED SEGMENT
This example problem illustrates the computation of the LOS in a single direction on a straight, 0.75 mi-long Passing Constrained segment in level terrain.

The Facts
The segment has the following known characteristics:
- Segment length = 3,960 ft (0.75 mi);
- Segment type = Passing Constrained;
- No upstream passing lanes;
- Vehicle count in the analysis direction = 752 veh/h;
- PHF = 0.94;
- Posted speed limit: 50 mi/h;
- Percent heavy vehicles (%HV) = 5%;
- Percent grade = 0%;
- Horizontal curvature = none;
- Lane width = 12 ft;
- Shoulder width = 6 ft; and
- Access points = 0.

Objective
Estimate the LOS in the subject direction on the two-lane highway segment as described.
